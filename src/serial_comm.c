/*
 * TODO
 * 
 * 1. Add a comment header explaing what the code in file does. Similar to this: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/tty/tty_port.c
 * 2. Add only the needed header files. Write the function implementation only. Include any global variable that you may be using in this file and make it static. 
 * 3. Be sure to check for error codes and failure conditions. In case of failure, print the appropriate message and return an error code (-1, -2 etc)
 * 4. Comment and intend the code correctly. Optimize of readibility.
 *    - add comments (explaining the API) for only the helper functions that are used in this file and mark them as static.
 *    - Do not add API comments for the public functions (functions that will be used in main.c)
 *    - you may add comments inside the function as needed. Keep them limited.
 * 5. Remove this block of comment.
