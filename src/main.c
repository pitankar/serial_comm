/*
 * TODO
 * 
 * 1. Add a comment header explaing what the code in file does. Similar to this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/include/linux/serial.h
 * 2. Add only the needed header files, any global variable that you used and the main function.
 * 3. Be sure to check for error codes and failure conditions. In case of failure, print the appropriate message and return an error code (-1, -2 etc)
 * 4. Comment and intend the code correctly. Optimize of readibility.
 * 5. Remove this block of comment.
